## Stock Simulator Web App

This App is a Node / ReactJS App that I created that ports the same functionality of the Stock Simulator Java App that
I created back in 2010 except this has a graphical UI and interactive chart functionality courtesy of HighCharts API.

It uses the `http://dev.markitondemand.com/` API to get the stock data instead of Google Finance API and as a result
it does not calculate stock indices.

## Instructions for running

Run `npm run build` from the root to build the app and run `node server` to get the server up and running.
By default it starts up on `http://localhost:9000/`.
